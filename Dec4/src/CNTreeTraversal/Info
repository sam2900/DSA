Code studio problem

here basically we need to return a list of lists, where each list will be inorder, preorder
and postorder traversal of the given tree

BFA:
    here i create 3 list and 1 ans list and then pass the 3 list to each recursive function
    for inorder, preorder and postorder traversals and add the nodes to these lists
    now since the list were create at main function so the reference remains the same

    after the function calls are finished we add the 3 lists into main ans list and return the ans

Optimisations
    1: using stack
    2: Morris traversal
