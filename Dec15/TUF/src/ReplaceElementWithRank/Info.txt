Replace Each Element Of Array With Its Corresponding Rank
Code Studio
Sample Input 2 :
5
1 2 6 9 2
Sample Output 2 :
1 2 3 4 2

Approach 1: BFA
    here basically i create 1 temporary list and add all elements into it
    then sort it
    now based on this sorted arr, i take each element and add it to the HashMap with the rank
    now after this we again traverse the unsorted arr and for each unsorted element
    we find the value/rank from the map and put it

Approach 2: better approach
    here everything is same, just instead of sorting we use heap
    and then maintain a rank var and put each element into map from heap
    then iterate the original arr and put the rank from map into temp list and return it
