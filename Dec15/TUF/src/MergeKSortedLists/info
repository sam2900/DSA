Appraoch 1:
    here basically i create a minHeap and then traverse each list, to add each element
    into the heap
    then after creation of heap, i will remove the element one by one to get them in
    sorted order and return the ans


Approach 2:
    here basically i will create a temp list and add all the elements into that
    then sort it using collections
    then traverse the list again and create a LL and return the ans
    here basically i create a list to store all the elements of all the k Linked lists
    //now we sort that list
    //after sorting we create a linked list for each of elements
    //tc: O(n) + O(nlogn) + O(n);

Approach 3:
    here basically i implement the mergeSort on the given array of LinkedLists
    since each list is sorted in itself
    so i call merge sort
