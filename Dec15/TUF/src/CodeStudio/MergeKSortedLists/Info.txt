here in cn we were given k ArrayLists and we need to merge them in sorted order

Approach 1:
    basically i created a minPriorityQueue and then for each list i added the elements into
    the pq
    after that since it is a min pq then it will maintain the sorted order
    so polled elements out of it one by one and added into the ans list and returned

    TC:
        addition of 1 element in pq take log n time
        so addition of n elements will take nlogn time
        now n is the total number of elements and there are k lists
        so the overall tc for addition is O(n*k*logn) + O(n*k*logn) -> for deletion

Approach 2:
    here we can simply add all the elements into the list, and then call merge sort
    TC:
        O(nLog(n));
