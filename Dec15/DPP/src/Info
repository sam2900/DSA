Approach 2:
    /**
    the approach is we will create a HashMap of Source to Destination
    now here after creating the map, i traverse over the values of map, that is all the destinations of the source

    the optimisation here done is
    we pick the first source given to us and then iterate over the destinations until we get a point for which we don't have any where else to go

    by doing this we don't have to travel all the values of map
    as from source there will definately a path to end so only 1 path is traversed not all */

Approach 1:

/**
the approach is we will create a HashMap of Source to Destination
now here after creating the map, i traverse over the values of map, that is tall the destinations of the source
and for each destination, i check whether it is a source or not,
if its a source move ahead else that will be the destination as from it we cannot reach anywhere else */
