606. Construct String from Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way, and return it.

Omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.

Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
Explanation: Originally, it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)"

Basically here i call the helper and ask the recursion to get left and right
and then if both are null or empty strings i return the root
if left is null and right is not, then i add an empty () and right's value
and similarly if right is null and left is not then add left and return
in the end i add both and return

now the optimised approach is
we use StringBuilder class, do a dfs traversal with the universal string
and if root is leaf then just return else there will atleast be 1 child
if left is null then i add empty () else in any other case just add
