215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

Better Approach:
    /**
    this is completely different approach
    here we basically maintain a minHeap of size k
    now everytime when the size of heap crosses k we poll 1 element out
    this way at the end the element at the top will be our kth largest element */


BFA:
    wahi build max heap and poll k-1 times when k==1 thats the ans

Naive:
    sort the array and return the kth element
