2500. Delete Greatest Value in Each Row

given mxn matrix, here everytime we have to find the maximum integer from each row of matrix and delete them
and add the maximum of them into ans
after each operation 1 column will be reduced

Approach 1: BFA
    here basically i used minHeap and TreeMap
    TreeMap is used to store the rows 0..n in sorted order and for each row a PQ to store the values in sorted order

    now the approach is using min PQ we will find the maximum in a column for each iteration and add it to ans

    now if we use minHeap, then we will find the max element in a column from 0..n
    but if we use maxHeap then we will start from n..0

many optimisations can be done
